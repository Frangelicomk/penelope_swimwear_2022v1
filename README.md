Jshint used to validate Javascript , The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of <br>the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. Color Contrast checker Coolors used to check the contrast and also pick the right colour palette for the website. Also for testing I used CLI to check for errors and fixed the issues showed in Problems tab.
+ [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
   + Most of JS was already there with the UI KIT I have done only few changes and added a custom JS to animate landing page. No much testing here
+ [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri+with_options)
   + Most of the errors are from the code I didnt write so I left them as they are. I fixed the issues on early stages of testing
+ [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
   + Only 1 error present and the warning come from the CSS I didnt write, it comes from the bootstrap.min.css
+ [Color Contrast Checker](https://color.a11y.com/)

   colors to meet the requirements of colortesting.
+ [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/)
   + Checked the site performance, the score wasnt bad, but I couldnt change the accessibilty issue. This comes from zooming in the site and for 1 more issue that I couldnt solve.


### Testing User Stories
+ User Stories

  + First Time Visitors

   1. For First time visitors the owner of the collection wished to have a big hero image to attract the viewer.
      - This have been achieved by the hero image on the landing page which is nicely responsive on every device.
        Also it showcases straight away that the site is about fashion/summer and clothing in general.
   2. Landing page to be minimal with few buttons and easy navigation.
      - Landin page is minimal with a nice animated navigation bar which translates into side navigation bar on small devices making access much easier
        for the users.
   3. First time visitors to be able to view quickly the products see prices and images for each product.
      - This have been achieved as the visitor can have a glance of the products on the landing page rather than navigating into collections
   4. To be able to securely and quickly check out.
      - This have been achieved using stripe documentation and the visitor is able to check out without loging in. Stripe takes protection to an other level.
      - Also the user will receive a confirmation email when checking out to his email address, check out withour providing a valid email address is not possible.
      - The form for secure check out requires validation and for security reasons all fields must be completed.
   5. To be able to adjust their bag
      - Users are able to adjust the bag accordingly this have been achieved with Javascript which I followed the instructions from Code Institute Boutique Ado
   6. Receive confirmation emails for their order.
      - Emails are now send to users as a confirmation of their order
   7. If they wish to send a message regarding a product or an order the visitor must be able to do so using an easy contact form located in the landing
   page.
      - This has been achieved as there is a new contact form nicely designed in the landing page and users can send emails directly to the Founder with any queries,
      this will be changed to an info mail when the site goes live.
   8. If they wish to create an account this must be an easy sign up process and also to keep their data secure.
      - This have been achieved by adding a new Sign in and Sign up button, the forms are easy to ready and to be followed and authentication is required. Once the users create
      and accound they will be redirected to the log in page after confirming their email address. On their account they will be able to see past order history.
   9. First time visitors should be able to subscribe/unsubscribe to newsletter.
      - There is a subscription button to newsletter, users must confirm again their email address this is to stop spam and also when they receive news letter they have the 
      option to unsubscribe. This doest work completely as it should be but more about this on the [Known Bugs Sections](##difficulties-encountered-&-bugs)

  + Returning Visitors 
    1. Should be able to to have all the perks from First time visitors list plus +
          + Able to quickly log in to their profile

            be more customised.
          + if they havent got an account yet to be able to register for an account this must be securely done and a confirmation email must be send.
            - Achieved again by Django Allauth form, there is a nicely designed sign up form which fields are required and user must confirm their email address before
            they get access to their account. Also due to authentication users can not use already taken emails.
          + Pop up messages to be active so they can see each actions taken while on the site.
            - Pop up messages work on each pages to inform users about their actions, for example when a user adds a product in the bag then a message pop ups on the top
            right which notifies user about the bag content. ( This was achieved with the help from Boutique Ado project. )
          + Design to be minimal and attractive to returning visitors and to showcase products to attract the eye.

+ Tested by friends from facebook and colleagues in differnt divices

  + As I did not have many time to create a type form again as I have done in the past so I can gather more feed back for testing and overall functionality. Friends and Colleagues tested all the buttons and links, repsonsiveness have been tested in laptops 13 and 17 inch screens. Computers with 17, 24, 27, 32 and 40 inch screens. and in noumerous off mobile devices. There is an unknown bug when you open the site with Mi navigation pages which HTML content dont load as they should be. I do not know what causing this glitch. Same phone with Chrome open works fine.

+ Feedback
  
  + The site got some nice feed back for the features and the upcoming features. I was not able to fix edit product page as I wanted as I do not personally like adding extra images for the products
  as it is now but I couldnt fix it. Also in the future I will add the option for the super user to be able to delete selected extra images, I didnt have the time to think about how this can be 
  achieved
  + The site over works fine, I am not happy how the newsletter turned up as the functionality doesnt work as I wanted. I will do more research about this.

### Further Testing
+ The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Safari browsers.
+ The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung S20/S22 Ultra and iPhoneX.
+ A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly. 
+ Friends, Colleagues from work and family members were asked to review the site and documentation <br>to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
+ I personally have access in 27" 4K Monitor, a 17" Laptop, Android phone which I constatly used for testing.
+ I have used Chrome Developer Tools as Opera Dev Tools to constantly check the website responsivness.
+ As I dont want more images on the markdown please find the testing screenshots on the testing folder. This can be achieved if you navigate on my github page then go to [penelope_swimwear_2022v1](https://github.com/Frangelicomk/penelope_swimwear_2022v1) project there you will find a folder named static
if you click on there you will see img then  a subfolder testing. If you right click on that folder you will see the images I have uploaded.
Alternatively you can click [here](https://github.com/Frangelicomk/penelope_swimwear_2022v1/tree/main/static/img/testing) to see the folder on my github straight away.

### Difficulties Encountered & Bugs

+ This will be a big section it seems. While when you are subscribing onto the email you receive an email to confirm emai this doesnt works as I wanted the generated email doesnt work.
  I tried to fix this but it gets worst every time i touch it, so I will try later again. If you confirm user from the admin panen subscribers then admins can send an email to all subscribers without any issue but again the link to unsubsribe doesnt work either.

+ An other bug was that I couldnt add extra images the way I wanted and every time i clicked add image this was creating instances with no images if it was left blank. Likely a Daisy Mentor from Slack helped me solve this issue. I changed the model field from Null=True to false so now you can not submit the form without adding an image. I know it doesnt look preaty as interface now that I added this feature but I will change it in the future. My plan was to create instances ( I believe with JS ) for every image I upload to create thubnails on the right side of the main image.
I wanted to write a code that for each image > 1 then that images will be automatically added as thubnails and extra images. Also when extra images are created I couldnt get the ID from those.
I think this sounds overall too complicated but I want to learn how to code what I have in my head the easy way.

+ I had a big issue when trying to update an product with no image as the default was not loading. That was very frustrating as the app kept crushing. Slack community helped me to fix this issue by migrating correctly changes in heroku directly.

+ I found it difficult to add staff members, I was thinking to create an app to add staff members with details and the 3 higher ranking to be displayed in the landing page ( team section )
this task was impossible so I gave up and did commit to git hub. I tested it on Vscode. ( When I tried to clone my project locally the vars werent working and I didnt know how to fix this. )

+ The most difficult part was to add extra images and for each extra image to create a carousel entry for the product details. It took me more than 2 days to set this up but I managed to solve it on my own using dev tools and inspecting admin, then I created the form on my own using the inspected attributes which fixed the issue.

+ There was a bug mentioned before if you open the app on Mi navigation the app doesnt load correctly Which still I dont know why. probably due to drivers.

+ I have done a lot of changes and While I Havent encountered many bugs the ones that I encountered took me long time to solve. Sounds easier that it was.

## AWS S3 Bucket Creation

### Creating S3 Bucket 

I have followed Code Institute Video + I read the documentation found in [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html)
When you create and upload your files to your bucket you need to set up the following variables in Heroku.

1. Go to your app_name
2. Click onto settings and the reveal conf vars
3. Add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = YOUR_KEY
4. Add AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
5. USE_AWS = True "This is because in developement we use static files and media files while when our app lunches we will use the S3 Bucket"
